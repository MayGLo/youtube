# What is Clubhouse?  How you can leverage it to stay up to date in DATA

### **What is clubhouse?**

**This invite-only, audio-based iPhone app is like listening in on someone else's phone call, legally.**

A social networking app that lets people gather in audio chat rooms to discuss various topics, whether it’s sports, wellness, art or why Bitcoin is headed to $87,000. Rooms are usually divided into two groups: those who are talking and those who are listening (participants can see a list of everyone who is in a conversation, and the numbers sometimes run into the thousands). Unlike Twitter, Clubhouse is a closed, hierarchical platform: A moderator oversees discussions and has the ability to let someone chime in or to kick out the unruly. In addition to the “clubs” sorted by topic, two or more users can join together and start their own chat room.

Their prototype of a podcasting app seemed too much like a broadcast, so they added a feature that let users join the conversation.

## Why it is so popular?

Even though it is invite-only, but due to popular personalities joining like 
Silicon Valley venture capitalists (Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, both early investors in the app), web-savvy entrepreneurs (Mark Cuban, Tim Ferriss), a smattering of performers and cultural influencers (Tiffany Haddish, Drake, Virgil Abloh), and people with random claims to fame (Vanilla Ice, Roger Stone).
Lately Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg 

## How it is different? AKA Better

- More engaging than posts and blogs
- No more clickbaity News feeds for content: Existing platforms like twitter,instagram,facebook heavily rely on these news feeds to engage users but platforms like clubhouse/reddit are more of community driven, there is option for you to choose specific communities and just engage with them
- No ads Yet

## **How can you get an invite?**

Clubhouse is currently available only on iOS. Each person invited to join is, in turn, given invitations to hand out (users who are active on the platform are granted more invites).

Invitations are going for between $30 and $20,000 on eBay.

+I will be giving away two invites which I have for two random people commenting on my video or follow my twitter account.
