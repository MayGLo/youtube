# Selecting the right database in Google Cloud

About GCP

Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offered by Google (company), is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, file storage, and YouTube.[3] Alongside a set of management tools, it provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics and machine learning.[4] Registration requires a credit card or bank account details.[5]

- You can always go and setup any open-source database on your own on a google virtual machine compute engine however google cloud provides an extensive set of fully managed database services. "Era of Fully Managed"
    - Firebase Storage
    - Cloud Storage
    - Cloud Spanner
    - Cloud SQL
    - Memorystore
    - Firestore
    - Big Table
    - Big Query
- Nowadays, choosing the right cloud-based product for your big data and machine learning workloads is a critical skill you will have to learn
- The most important of all is choosing the right database for your use cases.
- With so many options in cloud at our disposal with a click of a button can sometimes be overwhelming or confusing
